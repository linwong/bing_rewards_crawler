This is a python script that will open a Google Chrome browser and
do searches on Bing in order to gain Bing Rewards credits.

Requirements:
- python
- Selenium (version 2.26.0 or greater)
- Google Chrome (will work with other browsers, but you figure it out)

This has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04, with python 2.7.6, and Selenium
2.43.0.

To run:
python bing_rewards_crawler.py

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

1) This script will use a specified Google Chrome profile located by default in
~/bing_chrome/.  You can copy the profile from the default Chrome profile
(located in .config/google-chrome for me) to ~/bing_chrome/.  You will have
to have logged into Bing already in order for you to get Bing Rewards credits.

2) The default 14.04 Ubuntu repository has an older version of Selenium(2.25.0)
which will not work with this script.  You can install the newest version
here (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium)

3) You add this as a cron job to run daily.  For example
0 10 * * *  export DISPLAY=:0 && python /PATH_TO_SCRIPT/bing_rewards_crawler.py
