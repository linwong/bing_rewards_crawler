This is a python script that will open a Firefox browser and
do searches on Bing in order to gain Bing Rewards credits.

Requirements:
- python
- Selenium (version 2.26.0 or greater)
- Firefox

This has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04, with python 2.7.6, and Selenium
2.43.0.

To run:
python bing_rewards_crawler.py

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

1) This script will use a specified Firefox profile located by default in
~/bing_firefox/.  You can copy the profile from the default Firefox profile
(located in ~/.mozilla/firefox/ for me) to ~/bing_firefox/.  You will have
to have logged into Bing already in order for you to get Bing Rewards credits.

2) The default 14.04 Ubuntu repository has an older version of Selenium(2.25.0)
which will not work with this script.  You can install the newest version
here (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium)

3) You add this as a cron job to run daily.  For example
0 10 * * *  export DISPLAY=:0 && python /PATH_TO_SCRIPT/bing_rewards_crawler.py
